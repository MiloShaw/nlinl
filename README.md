# nlinl
modules manager for newlisp project. It is useful for search , download, update and import third-part modules for your newlisp project.

I finish a small useful tools named "nlinl" with newlisp. it is a modules manager and useful for search, download, install and import modules automically in newlisp project. Just used "(nlinl:import-module module-name)" to import third-part module which has been write by people in your newlisp project, if it is not exists, nlinl will autonamic search it, then download and load it. 

Why did i named it as 'nlinl' ? because the small tool of python named 'pip' ! :-)

It is the step one of whole plan.
